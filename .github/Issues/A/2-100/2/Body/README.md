A lot of images in this repository can significantly benefit from being converted to SVG. The current versions are mid to very low quality. I feel once 1 image is made into an SVG, it will be simple to do the rest.

Since I have very little experience in making SVG files, this will be a community goal. This issue will also be a reminder to myself that this will need to be done eventually.
